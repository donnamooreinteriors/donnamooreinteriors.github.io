            <p>“At the start of our project, Donna listened to us carefully, learned our goals and ideas for the space and then surpassed our expectations by creating an exquisite design for a master bathroom that we could not have imagined. She incorporated our aspirations and offered us a creative, carefully crafted vision of our new bathroom and bedroom, and used computerized graphics to show us what we could have.</p>
            <p>Then, once the work started, the attention and care Donna and her crew took with every detail, from the visibly seamless English wallpaper to the exceptional molding work around our shower, led to beautiful results. She offered little touches to make the master bathroom unique, such as crystal doorknobs.</p>
            <p>Donna and each of her contractors were always courteous, industrious and professional. They demonstrated a consistent conviction to do the job right the first time, and in a timely, efficient manner. We could not have been more thrilled with the results!”</p>

            <p>“Donna visualized the perfect master bath for us. She expanded our bathroom to encompass the dressing area, finding gorgeous wallpaper, a double sink vanity, incorporating a small TV in a wall niche, creating a make-up area between the sinks for convenience and also stayed true to our request for polished brass accents throughout.</p>
            <p>Her amazing crew hand-crafted French doors with a transom overhead to allow natural light into the master bath, and she topped it all off with crystal accents in the door knobs, Swarovski crystal drawer pulls, a dramatic crystal and gold lighting fixture, fabrics that updated three of our current pieces through reupholstering for our bedroom and bath, and by adding crown molding throughout.</p>
            <p>Her attention to detail also provided us with strict adherence to code and allowed us to address and upgrade a couple of electrical issues that could have posed a danger to our home in the coming years. Donna was also onsite while the work was being done, providing us confidence that the end product would meet her high standards.</p>
            <p>We highly recommend Donna Moore Interiors!”</p>

            <p>“I came to Donna with a problem. We wanted to fit an old family hope chest into our new contemporary townhouse design. Undaunted, she asked questions and listened carefully. Within a few days, she came to our house with beautiful fabric samples and a plan for the chest. It surpassed our expectations. Then Donna suggested other things we could do that would make our master bedroom unique.</p>
            <p>Months later while at a design show, Donna found a custom floor lamp she thought we might like and sent Donna, I have to smile. It feels good to have our room just the way we like it.</p>
            <p>Donna approaches small and large projects with the same creative talent, concern and effort. She took the time to understand what we wanted. I’ve seen how she looks at a room and visualizes it designed the way you would like it.</p>
            <p>Donna has the design expertise, the resources and a team to make things happen successfully. She is very much a professional who respects her clients’ opinions. She cares about her clients. Simply put, Donna is a really good person who is a gifted interior designer.”</p>

            <p>“I wanted a fresh new look for my home. I had some ideas but wasn’t sure what to do. Thanks to Donna’s design I am delighted with the changes!</p>
            <p>Donna’s client-centered approach to the design process contributed to her success. Initially, she asked questions to gain an understanding of my taste. She stayed focused on enhancing the design in the rooms I wanted to improve. As we progressed, Donna was very patient. She typically presented several solutions for improving a room. Sometimes she recommended redesigning items I owned, suggested a new purchase or did more research to find the best solution for me.</p>
            <p>During the months we worked together, I was impressed by Donna’s professionalism. She did an effective job scheduling and keeping tasks moving forward. She was excellent at keeping me informed about the status of purchases and vendor progress on jobs related to my project. I expect to work with Donna again in the future. In the meantime, I am thoroughly enjoying the results of her talent and skills.”</p>

            <p>“Donna’s detailed, hands-on approach helped me understand the required paperwork and language issues I experienced when I downsized from a single family home into a condo. I trusted Donna to take care of every aspect of my move and she did a very thorough job. She is honest and trustworthy.</p>
            <p>Donna faithfully managed the design and renovation of my new home to accommodate a family member with a disability. By organizing and reusing some of my furnishings, she helped me save money. When my brother visits, he comments on the beautiful wall colors and how Donna used some of our treasured artwork. We enjoy Donna’s great design. Friends and visitors often compliment me on my lovely new home.”</p>

            <p>“After many attempts to find the right color to paint our master bedroom, I  called Donna. She was highly recommended by a friend. We enjoyed working with her so much that we hired Donna to design our entire master bedroom suite, family room, kitchen, music room, dining room and formal living room.</p>
            <p>Donna took our house that was stuck in the ’80s and gave it a refreshing new look. We had many loved family pieces that we wanted to use but thought it was time to move them to the basement. Instead, Donna understood how we valued those family heirlooms. She worked with us to repurpose them for her design of our home. Donna’s sense of color, texture and functionality in her design really transformed our home. We’re looking forward to working with her on our next project.”</p>

            <p>“Having a beautiful home is important to us. Many homeowners design their home finding out during the process that it’s not easy or productive without a good interior designer’s skills.</p>
            <p>My wife saw Donna Moore’s work at a party and came home describing her skills. We set up an appointment with Donna to preview our home and learn how she might help us renovate it. She asked many questions and assured us that she would be there at every step of the design and construction process.</p>
            <p>Donna successfully incorporated my contemporary tastes with my wife’s traditional preferences. Her attention to detail was amazing! Donna Moore Interiors transformed our home from a very dated one into a home that should be featured in Southern Living Magazine. We are very pleased with Donna’s work and extremely proud of our new home.”</p>

            <p>“Donna, I am enjoying my wonderful chair. Since it was delivered, I spent many wonderful evenings and even a few nights dozing in it. The perfect dimensions make it a nest for me!</p>
            <p>And the ottoman is great. I can get  my feet up easily. Every time some friends and family visit it is the first thing mentioned.</p>

            <p>“My contemporary home no longer fit the way I actually lived. After meeting with Donna, I knew that she understood spatial design and could take my ideas from paper to finished product. Donna listened to what I wanted, respecting my desire to participate in decisions for the final transformation.  </p>
            <p>Donna not only created two beautiful new spaces, she helped me design other areas of my home that I had not considered. Her keen insight allowed me to see other spaces of my home in a new light. We continue to work together to revitalize the place I love and call home. I look forward to working with Donna on a major renovation of my master bath in the very near future!”</p>
